# Fetch Practice

This repo provides a backend server to practice with GET and POST requests.


## Backend Setup

1. Clone down this repo
1. `cd` into the cloned repo
1. Run `npm install`
1. Run `npm start`. The server should be running locally on `http://localhost:3001`
1. Navigate to the endpoint you're trying to request in the browser (for example, if you want to GET users, navigate to http://localhost:3001/api/v1/users in the browser)
1. Practice making your network requests in the console!


## Spicier Challenge

After you've done some network requests in the console, continue with implementing a network requests in a small front-end application included in this repo.

### Frontend Details


In the `client` directory, there are some files we can use as a makeshift client.

Finish early? Do the same thing for one of the other resources. ie. users or sports teams.
=======
1. Run `open client/index.html` from your command line to see the application in your browser
1. Follow the directions that are commented out in `client/index.js` to practice fetching!
